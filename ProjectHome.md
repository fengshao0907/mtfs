# Overview #
MTFS(`MulTi File System`) is a stackable file system, which takes multiple directories as its lower branches in order to add new features to existing file systems, including  replication, unification, tracing and more.
Mtfs is originally designed and mainly used as a reliability improvement mechanism for [Lustre file system](http://www.lustre.org). It aims to become a general platform for stackable file system development.

# Features #
  * Can be mounted on top of any combination of network, distributed, disk-based, and memory-based file systems. [A series of file systems](SupportedFileSystems.md) can be used as its lower file system including Lustre, ext2(3, 4), nfs, ntfs-3g and tmpfs.
  * Can be easily added support for new kinds of file systems.
  * Can take full advantage of characteristic features of a specific lower file system.
  * Have a test framework with plenty of test suites for the POSIX I/O interface, which is very helpful for its correctness.

When used as a reliability improvement mechanism for storage systems, mtfs is able to:
  * Replicate files and directories across multiple branches.
  * Selfheal if any branch is broken.
  * Replicate files synchronously or asynchronously.
  * Apply various replication policies according to file-name pattern.

# Quick start #
To use mtfs, you simply need to do the following:
  * Check whether the file system types of lower directories are [supported](SupportedFileSystems.md) by mtfs. If not, contact us to add support for it if you like to.
  * Check whether your [kernel](SupportedKernels.md) is supported by mtfs. If not, try to compile the source code. If the compiling fails, contact us if you like to.
  * [Install](Install.md) the kernel modules and userspace utils of mtfs
  * Mount mtfs file system to an existing mount point. For example:
```
mount -t mtfs /path/to/dir1:/path/to/dir2 /mnt/mtfs
```
  * Acces /mnt/mtfs as if it is a normal file system.
